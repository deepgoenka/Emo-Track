## üìä Features Extracted

From the audio files, 17 features were extracted using MATLAB with a Window size of 2048 and Overlap of 1024. These features include:

1. **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)**: Captures the spectral envelope of a signal.
2. **Delta MFCC**: First-order derivatives of MFCC coefficients which captures the rate of change of MFCCs over time.
3. **Delta Delta MFCC**: Second-order derivatives of MFCC coefficients which provides information about the acceleration or curvature of MFCCs over time.
4. **Mel Spectrogram**: Represents the power spectral density of a signal on a mel scale.
5. **Spectral Flux**: Measures the change in spectral shape over time.
6. **Spectral Skewness**: Describes the asymmetry of the spectral distribution.
7. **Spectral Slope**: Indicates the rate of change of spectral magnitude.
8. **Spectral Entropy**: Measures the amount of information in the spectral distribution.
9. **Spectral Rolloff**: Represents the frequency below which a certain percentage of the total spectral energy lies.
10. **Chromagram**: Captures the energy distribution of musical notes.
11. **Linear Predictive Coding (LPC)**: Models the spectral envelope of a signal using linear prediction.
12. **Zero Crossing rate (ZCR)**: Represents the rate at which the signal changes its sign.
13. **Energy**: Represents the signal's overall energy content.
14. **Pitch**: Indicates the perceived frequency of the signal.
15. **Intensity**: Represents the loudness of the signal.
16. **Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio (HNR)**: Measures the ratio of harmonic components to noise in the signal.
17. **Root Mean Square (RMS)**: Represents the average power of the signal over time.

These features represent various characteristics extracted from audio signals to capture relevant information for sentiment analysis.

## ü§ñ Model Training

**Feature Selection and Preprocessing:**
- Feature extraction from audio files resulted in a large number of features.
- To reduce dimensionality and focus on the most relevant features, an ExtraTreesClassifier was employed for feature selection.
- The best 30 features were chosen based on their importance scores.
- StandardScaler was applied to standardize the selected features, ensuring uniformity in their scales.

**Model Training:**
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel was chosen for its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and nonlinear relationships.
- The model was trained using an iterative process, exploring various combinations of C and gamma values.
- C represents the regularization parameter, controlling the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the classification error.
- Gamma defines the influence of a single training example, affecting the flexibility of the decision boundary.
- The model's accuracy was evaluated on a validation set, and the combination of C and gamma yielding the highest accuracy was selected.
- The chosen model was then saved for future use, allowing for quick and efficient sentiment analysis on new audio samples.
